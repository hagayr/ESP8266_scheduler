# ESP8266_scheduler
This is an Arduino project for the ESP8266 device family using the Blynk IoT Platform.
This Project implements a parametric scheduler with configurable number of schedulers and configurable number of times per scheduler.

Each scheduler can be used to control different hardware or software components.
 A hardware component can be relays, leds, or any hardware that is activated using the Arduino GPIO
 A software component can be a function or object that needs to be called at specific times for start and stop.
